h2. Quick and dirty usage:

 * sudo easy_install pytz
 * sudo easy_install vobject

 * cd django-schedule
 * export PYTHONPATH=..
 * cd project_sample
 * ./manage.py syncdb
 * ./manage.py load_example_data (optional, you can now also create calendars using /admin/ if you don't like 'example')
 * ./manage.py runserver
 
 * Go to /admin/ and create a new group and assign your user to it. This will make django-todo happy.
 * Go to /todo/ and create a list. Then you can create new items and with it content for the /
